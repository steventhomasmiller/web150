I would like to ask a few questions, if you're fine with that?

<script>
var name = prompt("What is your name?"); //Lets user give us a value
var fatherAge = prompt("How old is your father?");
fatherAge = Number(fatherAge);
console.log(typeof fatherAge);
console.log("So your name is " + name + ", is it? Cool. Glad I know."); //Lets user give us a value
console.log("Your father will be " + (fatherAge + 100) + " if he were to live for 100 more years. He'd probably be pretty #decreped at that point.");
console.log("That's all I have. For you.");
console.log("You can leave now.");
